# Tuttys-Website

Author: Shane Kennedy

Languages: HTML, CSS

This website is created as a project for my Web Dev class. The prompt is to make a made-up food place's website with 3 pages. All 3 pages are required to have the top navigation header and the contact information footer. The first page needs a hero image with text, a text-wrapped image, and another text-wrapped image with a sign up area. The second page needs a big image at the top, and text below it. The third page needs three columns, each with an image at the top and text below it.

This website is made for satirical enjoyment while fulfilling the need to turn in a working website. This site will not be made to work well with mobile. Since I am just recently getting into responsive web design, I still have awhile to go before I start making mobile friendly websites that can work reactively with the normal, desktop, sized websites.

This website is currently unfinished and still being updated.

Looney Tunes/Warner Bros. please don't come for me, I'm just having fun.
