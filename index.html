        <p id="wrapped-text">Welcome to Tutty's! Where everyday you will see the same waitress and she will always be too happy about your orders (yes we know, we did it on purpose). It may seem creepy to some, but don't worry! We're meant for animals! Ducks, bunnies, pigs, mice, all animals are welcome! Our waitress may be human, but she loves animals too. Don't worry though, we keep the place spotless, it's almost like the place is hand drawn. We even have a variety of choices on our menu for everyone's delight. Do you have a party, get-together, date, or just trying to think about something? Have no fear, just come on down to Tutty's! We also allow for contactless delivery and pickup. With the sudden pandemic, even if we serve animals, we have to follow the regulations of the world. We are always here to be that constant to have peace of mind while you do whatever you want.</p>

                <p id="left-aligned-text">Our menu has gone through quite a few changes since our opening and we believe we have found a good balance. We love when our customers give us some constructive critcism (except the chef, he's kind of a grouch). If requested, we will even give a form where you can suggest a new menu item or some type of improvement we can make. Perfection is impossible to achieve, but will always be what we strive for here at Tutty's. We are always looking for new employees to add to our great team to continue down the path to perfection with us.
